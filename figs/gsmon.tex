	{Structure of \Tech{gsmon}.  Differing line styles represent
	sample message routes.	The message of \Subject{Subsystem~1}
	is written to the terminal, while the one of \Subject{Subsystem~2}
	is appended to a file.  The third one is eaten up, because
	the monitor has been configured not to deliver messages of
	\Subject{msgclass~3} at that severity level.}

	{Internal representation of menu hierarchies.  Ellipses stand
	for GA genomes, arrows indicate attribute-of relationships
	between.  Note that the arrows originating from the rectangles
	of populations are meant to signify that all genomes contained
	have the same set of attributes, only with different values.}

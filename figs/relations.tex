\caption[Possible relations between solutions and attributes]%
	{Possible relations between solutions and attributes.
	Boxes enclose attribute types, ovals do solution types.
	\Tech{ATOM}ic solutions are ones that are not evolved
	in a GA population, while \Tech{GENOME} ones are.
	Entities linked with ``TOP'' are eligible for being
	at the top of the \Link<GA hierarchy>; similarly for
	``BOT''.}

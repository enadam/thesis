	[1]{Layers of \Menugene}\vrule
	[2]{Current structure of \Menugene.  Underlined labels mean
	the component is not an in-house development.  The dashing of
	\Tech{MenuGeneAdmin} is meant to symbolize the author did not
	work on it.}

	[3]{A possible architecture for the enterprise market.}
\caption[System structure]%
	{System structure.  Arrows express \emph{use}-relationship and
	direction.  The line style indicates the kind of communication
	transport.  Solid lines: local, dotted lines: (inter)networked,
	dot-dash: \Either[RMI][CORBA].  Nodes with rounded corners are
	visible to end-users.  Box shading emphasizes the centrality of
	a component.}
